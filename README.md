# ann-sol.com

Web frontend for Ann.sol (hosted at ann-sol.com)

See [ann-sol.com](ann-sol.com) or `index.html` for an overview.

## Ann.sol contract

See https://github.com/exo-one/ann.sol for contract code.

## Editing

If using any browserify modules please add the `require` to `src/main.js` and run `npm run build` to generate `js/bundle.js`

The site is made using mostly BassCSS and AngularJS.

I usually run browser-sync in the background to make thing easier.

## Contributing

Generally speaking code should be indented with 4 spaces.

ES6 is okay.

If you'd like to redesign the site you are very welcome to (yes, it is quite ugly, isn't it).
