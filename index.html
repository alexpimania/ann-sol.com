<h2>How does this work?</h2>

<p>
    Ideally the announcer will have an ENS domain ready to go. Ideally they'd point the domain (or a subdomain, e.g.
    ann.cooltoken.eth) to their announcement contract.
</p>

<p>
    The announcement contract accepts an IPFS hash (or arbitrary string, really) from the announcer (which is the owner).
    Before that announcement goes live, though, it must be approved by some of the auditors.
</p>

<p>
    The auditors are set at the time of the contract creation and there is some minimum number required to release an announcement.
    The owner might set herself as the auditor (or some other accounts they control) - this is a Bad Idea (tm). Ideally
    the auditors are reasonably well known figures in the community and their role is to verify announcements are legitimate
    before they are published. Users should therefore be suspicious if the auditors are not publicly declared and confirmed.
    The confirmation process can be done however they choose, such as over video chat, though they may also choose
    a more rigorous process. The idea is that this step, even if conducted in a very low effort manner, will prevent
    99% of bad announcements getting through. (And, of course, it doesn't necessarily prevent the $5 wrench attack, but
    that's a topic for another day). Crucially, this is dependent on <i>people and meaning</i>, not just cryptography or
    the security of a web server.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, the auditors may choose to sound an alarm instead of giving the okay for any announcement. There is also
    a threshold for the number of alarms that must be triggered before an announcement is blacklisted.
</p>

<p>
    If the announcement is an IPFS hash then the contents will be shown in the browser, otherwise the raw string will be shown.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, all config URLs are stored in js/1_config.js. If you download the repository and replace the URLs with
    local nodes you can use this site locally.
